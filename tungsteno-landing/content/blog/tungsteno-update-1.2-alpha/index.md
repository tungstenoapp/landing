## Test it! (Download it!)

I am working on a simplified installation method available for all operating systems. Right now, there is no executable available to download and install directly. However, Tungsten has a Docker version available, which you can run directly. You can also run it from the repository, or from the demo link:

[demo.tungsteno.app](https://demo.tungsteno.app)
