    Tungsteno is a **programming language** developed **for doing science in a simple way**. Developed so that **everyone can collaborate in its development**, and **adapt the software to their needs** easily using the module APIs.
    **Tungsteno is free software**, so **you can modify it as you wish**, **distribute it among your friends and scientific colleagues**, and you can **study how it works**, and **improve it**. _That's science!_

    Tungsteno aims to be 100% compatible with Wolfram Mathematica.

        Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No! These are screenshots of Tungsteno in operation.

        Here you can see Tungsteno solving integrals of several variables, autocompleting your code, its interface, simplifying algebraic expressions and generating 3D graphics. It doesn't even blink.

        Tungsteno is designed to be developed in community. That's why all Tungsteno code is hosted on Github and all Github users can collaborate by adding features, fixing bugs and proposing improvements. In addition, the Github repository maintains a dashboard where you can see the roadmap of the project.

        One of the features coming soon to Tungsteno will be the possibility to download and upload features to a repository to facilitate the distribution and incorporation of new features. Stay tuned!

        Access our Github and start collaborating!
